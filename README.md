Analyzed genomic sequences to distinguish three species based on codon usage patterns and nucleotide composition.

ðŸ“Š Key Steps:

#Data Preprocessing: 

  Filtered out sequences shorter than 100 bp and validated feature ranges (ENC: 20-64, CAI: 0-1, GC123% related to GC%).
#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 

  Conducted per-species statistical analysis and visualized distributions using boxplots.
#Feature Selection & Visualization: 

  Tested feature pairs (e.g., Length Ã— GC%, Length Ã— ENC) with scatter plots to determine the best distinguishing factors.
#K-Means Clustering: 

  Applied clustering and evaluated species separation through silhouette scores to identify the optimal parameter set.
ðŸ“ˆ Outcome:

Successfully visualized and classified species based on codon usage bias, optimizing clustering parameters for the best distinction.
